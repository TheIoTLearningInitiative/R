# Introduction

> R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing.[3] The R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software[4] and data analysis.[5] Polls, surveys of data miners, and studies of scholarly literature databases show that R's popularity has increased substantially in recent years.
